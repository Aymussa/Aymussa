 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Ahmed's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I started my coding journey by joining a hackathon. I was a bit nervous when I first joined at the hackathon. I had never coded before, and I didn't know what to expect. But I was determined to give it my best shot.

I joined a team of three other people, and we started brainstorming ideas. We decided to build a website that would help people find investment to their busniess and give people choice to invest in different people business. We worked for 24 hours straight, and by the end of the hackathon, we had a working prototype.

We were so excited when we won the hackathon! It was a great feeling to know that our hard work had paid off. The hackathon was a great experience, and it gave me the confidence to pursue a career in development.

I then enrolled in a 16-week intensive frontend development bootcamp, where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React. After completing the bootcamp, I took my journey to my own hands and started learning Python. I am still in the early stages of learning Python, but I am excited to continue growing my skills.

I am a quick learner and I am always eager to take on new challenges. I am also a team player and I am always willing to help others. I am confident that I have the skills and the drive to be a successful developer.
